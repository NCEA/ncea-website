      Being an old girl of HGHS, itâ€™s exciting to be back at school! I hope that
      students will question, explore and discover the good news of Jesus for
      themselves. Regardless of where they may be on their faith journey, I pray
      that SRE will help them to move one step (or more!) closer to knowing
      Jesus.

      I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to
      think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves
      believe and why, and what impact this has on their lives. In doing so, I
      hope to show how the truth of the Gospel shines brighter than all other
      beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity.

Formed in 1991 with the objective of providing a high standard of Christian
Education in local state high schools, the NCEA now employs Christine Chin
to work at Hornsby Girls' High School, and Tony Jones to work at Normanhurst
Boys' High School.

Both are employed on a part-time basis and teach using the
Youthworks Think Faith Curriculum (see below for how this looks in each
school). They are authorised to teach Special Religious Education (SRE) by The
Anglican Diocese of Sydney which is an approved provider of SRE in NSW public
schools.

The NCEA is administered by a Management Committee representing six
local churches and supported by eleven churches in the area (these churches
are listed with details on the homepage). The annual budget is approximately
$110,000.
