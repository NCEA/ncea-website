      Let me introduce myself, as I did to my students — along with their
      responses. I attended Hornsby Girls’ High School (HGHS) in 1994 (surprised
      looks). I was a secondary English teacher before having four kids; my
      eldest Is currently In Year 9 at Normanhurst Boys’ High School (interested
      looks). When I’m not at HGHS, I’m at Barker College as a Teacher Librarian
      and Philosophy teacher. I attend Pennant Hills Baptist and enjoy running
      to music (keen looks and many K-pop recommendations). I am Christine Chin,
      Special religious Education teacher at Hornsby Girls’ High School.

      I’m so thankful and relieved for the warm welcome by the students. They
      each wrote me a letter and they certainly are a diverse, interesting, and
      talented bunch. The majority are from Hindu/Buddhist/non-religious
      backgrounds with a handful of Christians, including a number who are
      doubting their faith. Students have been generally receptive as we’ve
      discussed the Bible, faith and tackled some big questions, like ‘Why is
      there suffering in the world?’

      A recent highlight was from a Year 8 class. I told the Bible story of
      Lazarus three times - once for the students to imagine, next for them to
      remember because the last time they were invited to help me retell the
      story. We had thoughtful questions and rich discussion as we made links
      with Jesus’ death and resurrection.

      A student commented, “I learnt that Jesus died and got resurrected. I did
      not know he came alive after he died.” It was a powerful reminder that the
      Bible speaks for itself, and we can have confidence that God’s word will
      convict hearts and change lives.

      I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to
      think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves
      believe and why, and what impact this has on their lives. In doing so, I
      hope to show how the truth of the Gospel shines brighter than all other
      beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity.

Formed in 1991 with the objective of providing a high standard of Christian
Education in local state high schools, the NCEA now employs Elizabeth Harnwell
to work at Hornsby Girls' High School, and Tony Jones to work at Normanhurst
Boys' High School. Both are employed on a part-time basis and teach using the
Youthworks Think Faith Curriculum (see below for how this looks in each
school). They are authorised to teach Special Religious Education (SRE) by The
Anglican Diocese of Sydney which is an approved provider of SRE in NSW public
schools.  The NCEA is administered by a Management Committee representing six
local churches and supported by eleven churches in the area (these churches
are listed with details on the homepage). The annual budget is approximately
$110,000.
