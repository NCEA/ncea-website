      I am so thankful to God for my years teaching SRE at Hornsby Girls High
      School. I hope to teach girls about the goodness of God, his Word, and
      what it means to follow Him. I hope to shine a light at Hornsby Girls High
      School so all the girls have the opportunity to meet Jesus and see that he
      is our Lord and Saviour.

      I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to
      think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves
      believe and why, and what impact this has on their lives. In doing so, I
      hope to show how the truth of the Gospel shines brighter than all other
      beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity.

Formed in 1991 with the objective of providing a high standard of Christian
Education in local state high schools, the NCEA now employs Elizabeth Harnwell
to work at Hornsby Girls' High School, and Tony Jones to work at Normanhurst
Boys' High School. Both are employed on a part-time basis and teach using the
Youthworks Think Faith Curriculum (see below for how this looks in each
school). They are authorised to teach Special Religious Education (SRE) by The
Anglican Diocese of Sydney which is an approved provider of SRE in NSW public
schools.  The NCEA is administered by a Management Committee representing six
local churches and supported by eleven churches in the area (these churches
are listed with details on the homepage). The annual budget is approximately
$110,000.
