  Formed in 1991 with the objective of providing a high standard of Christian
  Education in local state high schools, the NCEA now employs Elizabeth Harnwell
  to work at Hornsby Girls' High School, and Tony Jones to work at Normanhurst
  Boys' High School. Both are employed on a part-time basis and teach using the
  Youthworks Think Faith Curriculum (see below for how this looks in each
  school). They are authorised to teach Special Religious Education (SRE) by The
  Anglican Diocese of Sydney which is an approved provider of SRE in NSW public
  schools.  The NCEA is administered by a Management Committee representing six
  local churches and supported by eleven churches in the area (these churches
  are listed with details on the homepage). The annual budget is approximately
  $110,000. ([HGHS SRE Program: Think Faith

      I am so thankful to God for the opportunity to start teaching SRE at
      Hornsby Girls’ High School (HGHS) this year. Although I am only new to the
      school, I already feel very happy there. The staff have gone out of their
      way to make sure I feel welcome and the Principal and the Executive have
      been very supportive.

      I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to
      think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves
      believe and why, and what impact this has on their lives. In doing so, I
      hope to show how the truth of the Gospel shines brighter than all other
      beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity.
