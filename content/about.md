      I hope that students will question, explore and discover the good news of
      Jesus for themselves. Regardless of where they may be on their faith
      journey, I pray that SRE will help them to move one step (or more!) closer
      to knowing Jesus.

      I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to
      think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves
      believe and why, and what impacts this has on their lives. In doing so, I
      hope to show how the trust of the Gospel shines brighter than all other
      beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity.
