  - name: Tony Jones
    description: "Tony Jones has a Bachelor of Science and is just finishing a Masters of Divinity. He is a former student of James Ruse Agricultural High School and currently teaches SRE part-time at Marsden High School."
    quote: "I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves believe and why, and what impact this has on their lives. In doing so, I hope to show how the truth of the Gospel shines brighter than all other beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity."
