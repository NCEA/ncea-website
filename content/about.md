      I hope that students will question, explore and discover the good news of
      Jesus for themselves. Regardless of where they may be on their faith
      journey, I pray that SRE will help them to move one step (or more!) closer
      to knowing Jesus.

      I hope that SRE will be a chance for students to take the opportunity to
      think about religion and belief, in particular, what they themselves
      believe and why, and what impacts this has on their lives. In doing so, I
      hope to show how the trust of the Gospel shines brighter than all other
      beliefs; impacting the way that all of us live both now and into eternity.

The Normanhurst Christian Education Association (NCEA) was formed in 1991 with the purpose of providing a high standard of Special Religious Education at Hornsby Girls High School and Normanhurst Boys High School. 

The NCEA is represented by denominations of churches in Sydney’s Upper North Shore, each of which are on the Department of Education’s list of approved providers.

The NCEA appoints and employs two part-time SRE teachers for Hornsby Girls High School and Normanhurst Boys High School. 

Our SRE Teachers have been authorised by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney or the NSW & ACT Baptist Association. This includes a Working with Children Check number, church-based child protection training, compliance with the Department of Education’s Code of Conduct, yearly training for teaching development and school authorisation card.
